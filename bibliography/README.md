# Bibliography

This folder contains all the scripts and data needed for building the Bibliography page.

The following scripts should be only be run during deployment, or manually as needed on your local machine, since the Zotero bibliography isn't updated regularly.

- `getBibliographyData.js`
- `createBibliographyHTML.js`

The linguistics stylesheet comes from [here](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles/blob/master/generic-style-rules-for-linguistics.csl). You can find other stylesheets in that same repository. Zotero seems to use that repo for its list, so you can test out different styles in Zotero.
