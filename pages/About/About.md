## Introduction {#introduction}

This project is an NSF-funded cross-linguistic database of the components which make up words in Algonquian languages. There are two main goals:

1. To provide tribes with a source for lexical expansion for their language revitalization/reclamation projects.
2. To provide a basis for comprehensive reconstruction of Proto-Algonquian.

This database is be a web-based, open-access, centralized resource for Algonquian word components, providing community members and linguists with a set of data that has previously been difficult to access. [Explore the database here.](/search)

## Algonquian Components Bibliography {{> backlink/backlink }} {#bibliography}

The [Algonquian Components Bibliography](/bibliography) is a set of resources used in the Nisinoon project to collect data on derivational morphemes in Algonquian languages. (It is not intended to be an exhaustive bibliography on Algonquian languages!) It was compiled by Monica Macaulay (University of Wisconsin-Madison) and [Hunter Lockwood][website-hunter] (Myaamia Center, Miami University) with the help of Rachel Fedorchak, Anushri Kartik-Narayan, Eleanor Sand, and Savana Stauss.

If you see an error in this bibliography, or would like to suggest any additions, please email Monica Macaulay at [mmacaula@wisc.edu](mailto:mmacaula@wisc.edu).
